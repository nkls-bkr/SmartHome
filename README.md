# SmartHome
## What is this project all about?
This is a Java application built with Spring Data JPA and Spring MVC for collecting temperature and humidity data via an Arduino-based temperature sensor.

## Why hexagonal architcture?
At this point, just collecting temperature and humidity is implemented. In the future there may be different smart home gadgets which need to be implemented into the application. The hexagonal architecture provides the flexibility and scalability to easily add new technologies into the existing application.
